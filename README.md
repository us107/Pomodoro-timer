# Pomodoro-timer
The Pomodoro Timer is a web app that boosts productivity using the Pomodoro Technique. It breaks work into 25-minute intervals ("Pomodoros") with short breaks in between. After four Pomodoros, a longer break is taken. This timer helps users manage their work sessions and breaks effectively.
